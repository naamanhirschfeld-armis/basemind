## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-17

**Minor release — schema wipe (`RELEASE_MINOR=2`).** The blob and inverted-index
formats are versioned to the release minor, so the next `basemind scan` rebuilds
`.basemind/` from source. This is the intentional migration path; no user action
beyond a rescan is needed.

### Changed

- **Dependencies on crates.io.** `kreuzberg` moved from the `v5.0.0-rc.15` git pin
  to the published crates.io release `=5.0.0-rc.18`; the temporary `allow-git`
  exemptions in `deny.toml` are dropped. With no remaining git dependencies,
  `cargo publish` to crates.io is unblocked — basemind now ships on all four
  registries (crates.io, npm, PyPI, Homebrew) from a single tag.
- **README is now a positioning document.** Rewritten from a code-map feature
  inventory into a full AI-context-layer overview: four pillars (Code, Documents,
  Memory, Web), a feature table mapping every MCP tool to its backend, a
  three-flavour quickstart, comparisons against grep / vector-only RAG /
  repo-map indexers / GitHub search, and a differentiators section. Sub-package
  READMEs (npm / PyPI / OpenCode) collapse to install stubs linking the root.
- **Aligned package metadata across all surfaces.** One canonical description and
  a positioning-led 5-keyword set (`mcp`, `agent-context`, `rag`, `code-map`,
  `tree-sitter`) now ship identically across `Cargo.toml`, the npm / PyPI
  manifests, and every harness plugin manifest. GitHub repo description + topics
  updated to match.

### Added

- **Redesigned Claude Code statusline.** Bright 256-color palette (no more
  low-contrast dim text), a `◆` brand mark, a dedicated serve/scan freshness
  dot, and width-aware wide/narrow layouts. The file count now reads the L1 blob
  set directly (exact, deduped) instead of estimating from index bytes; scan
  recency reads the view index mtime; an empty repo renders an actionable
  `run: basemind scan` hint instead of a blank line. The intelligence row
  (documents / memory / web) appears when a LanceDB store is present.
- **Agent-facing skills + slash commands bundled into every plugin tree.** The
  `basemind` routing skill and `basemind-stats` dashboard, plus `/bm` and
  `/bm-stats` slash commands, now ship inside `.claude-plugin/`, `.codex-plugin/`,
  `.cursor-plugin/`, and the `basemind-opencode` npm tarball — so an installed
  plugin teaches the agent how to use the tools without manual onboarding. A new
  `scripts/sync-plugin-skills.sh` (wired as a prek hook) keeps the canonical
  source and the per-harness copies in lock-step.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **`npm-package`** — `npx basemind …` (and equivalent `npm install -g basemind`
  invocations) used to silently fall through to whatever `basemind` already lived
  on `$PATH` because npm skipped creating the `node_modules/.bin/basemind`
  symlink when the `bin:` target was missing at install time (the native binary
  is downloaded by `postinstall`). The wrapper now ships a Node.js shim at
  `bin/basemind.js` that `spawnSync`'s the downloaded native binary, so the
  symlink target exists at install time and npx routes correctly through the
  wrapper.
- **`publish.yaml`** — re-enabled the Homebrew tap step now that
  `HOMEBREW_TOKEN` is on the path to being provisioned. Set the secret on the
  basemind repo before pushing the next tag; goreleaser will then auto-update
  `Goldziher/homebrew-tap`'s `Formula/basemind.rb`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-15

**Initial public release.** First minor wipes the schema (`RELEASE_MINOR=1`)
so any pre-tag `.basemind/` cache rebuilds on next scan — intentional.

Feature-complete code-map server with the kreuzberg document tier surface
(reranker, keywords, NER, summarization, language detection, TOON output) and
schema-driven config across TOML / CLI / MCP / env vars, distributed across
all major coding-agent harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Factory
Droid, OpenCode, Copilot CLI, and the generic MCP path) plus npm / PyPI /
crates.io.

### Added

- **`basemind scan`** — rayon-parallel scanner that indexes a workspace into
  content-addressed msgpack blobs (`.basemind/blobs/`) plus a Fjall-backed
  inverted index (`.basemind/views/<view>/index.fjall/`). Two extraction tiers
  ship: L1 outlines (symbols, signatures, imports, docs) and L2 call sites;
  L3 structural hash available for symbol-history diffing.
- **`basemind serve`** — stdio MCP server (`rmcp`) exposing the full code-map
  and git-history tool surface (`outline`, `search_symbols`, `find_references`,
  `find_callers`, `list_files`, `dependents`, `repo_info`, `status`,
  `symbol_history`, `working_tree_status`, `recent_changes`,
  `commits_touching`, `find_commits_by_path`, `diff_file`, `diff_outline`,
  `hot_files`, `blame_file`, `blame_symbol`).
- **Dynamic 300+ language coverage** via
  [tree-sitter-language-pack](https://github.com/kreuzberg-dev/tree-sitter-language-pack).
  Hand-written `.scm` overrides ship for Rust, Python, TypeScript, TSX,
  JavaScript, Go. Other languages for which TSLP ships a vendored `tags.scm`
  (kotlin, csharp, swift, cpp, scala, solidity, lua, …) get best-effort
  symbol + call extraction via the fallback adapter that rewrites
  GitHub-standard `@definition.*` / `@reference.call` captures into
  basemind's `@symbol.*` / `@call.*` shape.
- **Schema-driven config across TOML / CLI / MCP / env vars.** Rust types in
  `src/config/` derive `schemars::JsonSchema`; the snapshot at
  `schema/basemind-config-v1.schema.json` is regenerated from those types and
  asserted by `tests/config_schema.rs`. Adding a config field lights up all
  four surfaces via `#[command(flatten)]` (clap) and `#[serde(flatten)]` (MCP
  params). Precedence: MCP > CLI > env > TOML > defaults, with per-field
  provenance tracking via `src/config/source.rs`.
- **Document tier** — `search_documents` MCP tool over Lance-backed embedding
  index with kreuzberg ingestion. Per-query overrides on every `documents.*`
  and `llm.*` setting, plus `entity_category` and `keywords_contains`
  post-filters.
- **TOON wire format** for MCP responses via
  `documents.output.format = "toon"` (or `--documents-output-format toon`).
  Round-trip parity with JSON asserted in `tests/mcp_smoke.rs`.
- **Language-aware ingestion.** `documents.language.{auto_detect,
  min_confidence, detect_multiple}` flows into kreuzberg's
  `LanguageDetectionConfig` and the chunking tokenizer. ISO 639-3 codes (e.g.
  `"fra"`) surface on `FileMapDoc.detected_languages`.
- **Cross-encoder reranker** as a post-step on `search_documents`. Off by
  default; `documents.reranker.{enabled,preset,top_k}` opts in. Preset is
  validated upfront against `kreuzberg::get_reranker_preset`; reranked index
  is bounds-checked before reorder.
- **Keyword extraction (YAKE / RAKE) and named entity recognition** at
  extract time. New tail fields on `FileMapDoc` (`keywords`, `entities`)
  with `#[serde(default)]` — blob-compatible with prior blob shapes
  (asserted by `tests/schema_bump.rs`).
- **Extractive + abstractive summarization** via `documents.summarization`.
  Abstractive routes through liter-llm with the new top-level `[llm]`
  section (model in `provider/model` form, api_key, base_url, temperature,
  timeout, retries, max_tokens). NER backend `llm` now wires the resolved
  `LlmConfig`.
- **`SecretString` newtype + `ApiKey` enum** (`Literal | Env | Unset`).
  Secrets mask to `"<redacted>"` in `Debug` / `Display` and across
  `Serialize` (including the toml→serde_json validation round-trip).
- **Real-OSS hardening harness** (`tests/harden.rs`, `./scripts/harden.sh`)
  — clones 8 upstream repos (ripgrep, tokio, typescript, react, django,
  requests, gin, ripgrep-shallow), exercises every MCP tool against each,
  and pins canary lower bounds (tokio: `find_references("spawn") >= 200`,
  django: `find_references("get") >= 200`,
  react: `search_symbols("useState") >= 20`,
  ripgrep-shallow truncation surfaces).
- **Schema sync to release version** — `RELEASE_MINOR` in `src/version.rs`
  drives both `INDEX_SCHEMA_VER` and the blob `SCHEMA_VER`. Minor-release
  bumps wipe `.basemind/` on next scan; patch releases stay compatible.
- Distribution: `brew install Goldziher/tap/basemind`,
  `npm install -g basemind`, `pip install basemind`,
  `cargo install basemind --locked`. Precompiled binaries on GitHub
  Releases for `{x86_64,aarch64}-{linux-gnu,apple-darwin}` and
  `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.
- **Per-harness install matrix** — manifests + skill bundle for every major
  coding-agent harness, all bumped in lock-step by
  `task release:sync-version VERSION=…`:
  - **Claude Code** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` +
    `statusline.sh` (live one-line summary of the indexed map with true-color
    brand mark, freshness dot, and call/token-savings telemetry from
    `.basemind/telemetry.jsonl`). Install via
    `/plugin marketplace add Goldziher/basemind` then
    `/plugin install basemind@basemind`.
  - **Codex CLI / App** — `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` with full `interface`
    block (`displayName`, category `Developer Tools`, `capabilities`,
    `defaultPrompt`, `brandColor`). `scripts/sync-to-codex-plugin.sh` mirrors
    into a fork of the `openai/plugins` marketplace.
  - **Gemini CLI** — root-level `gemini-extension.json` with `contextFileName`
    and `mcpServers`. Install via
    `gemini extensions install https://github.com/Goldziher/basemind`.
  - **Cursor** — `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`.
  - **OpenCode** — published as the
    [`basemind-opencode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/basemind-opencode)
    npm package. Install via
    `{ "plugin": ["basemind-opencode@latest"] }` in `opencode.json`. Skills
    are bundled into the tarball; the plugin shim does dual-mode resolution
    (bundled-path-first, repo-root-fallback) so monorepo dev and npm install
    both work without duplication.
  - **Factory Droid / GitHub Copilot CLI** — reuse the existing
    `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` per their published patterns.
  - Every manifest carries the same canonical user-facing description and
    crates.io-capped 5-keyword set (`mcp`, `tree-sitter`, `code-map`,
    `scanner`, `indexer`).
- **Release pipeline** — `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` publishes on
  every `v*` tag: GitHub release assets (cross-compiled binaries via
  goreleaser + zig), crates.io, npm × 2 (`basemind` binary wrapper +
  `basemind-opencode` OpenCode plugin), and PyPI. Per-registry idempotent
  via existing-version detection; OIDC-driven trusted publishers on all
  four registries.

### Changed

- `tree-sitter-language-pack`: `=1.9.0-rc.27` → `=1.9.0-rc.45`. Hierarchical
  `data_extraction` + 17 data formats; rc.40–45 are CI/codegen-only.
- `kreuzberg` bumped to the reranker / LLM API surface
  (`=5.0.0-rc.7` baseline → published rc covering reranker + LLM at publish
  time).
- `alloc-stdlib = "=0.2.2"` pin lifted (no longer binding after lock
  re-resolve; single `alloc-no-stdlib 2.0.4` in the tree).
- `src/mcp/types.rs` + `src/mcp/helpers.rs` split into `_documents.rs`
  siblings to stay under the 1000-line cap.

### Performance

- Harden 8/8 green across ripgrep / tokio / typescript / react / django /
  requests / gin / ripgrep-shallow. All canaries pass. Per-repo scan times
  within baseline: typescript 21.7 s (81 324 files), tokio 0.2 s (859
  files), django 2.5 s (7 061 files), react 2.2 s, requests 0.7 s, gin
  1.0 s, ripgrep 4.0 s, ripgrep-shallow 0.16 s. All 25 MCP tools clean
  across all repos.
- `search_documents` post-processing releases the store read-lock before
  blob I/O; `ahash::AHashMap` / `AHashSet` on the post-filter path.
