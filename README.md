# basemind

**The full context layer for coding agents.** One MCP server that turns any repository into a
queryable code map, document library, and shared memory — so agents navigate by **structure and
search** instead of burning context on `grep` and file reads.

Code map & search across **300+ languages** · document processing for **90+ file formats** ·
semantic + full-text search · git history & blame · shared agent memory · on-demand web crawl

## The four pillars

**Code** — Tree-sitter outlines, symbol search, reference + caller + implementation graphs,
call chains, git history per symbol, blame at symbol-level resolution.

**Documents** — Ingest + semantic search over PDFs, Office (Word/Excel/iWork), HTML, email,
archives. Built-in OCR, layout detection, keyword + NER extraction, cross-encoder reranking.
All ONNX bundled — no system install needed.

**Memory** — Per-repo scoped key-value + semantic vector storage. Clones of the same git
origin automatically share memory; unrelated repos isolated.

**Web** — On-demand HTTP scrape + follow-link crawl. Pages chunk, embed, and land in the
documents store under scope `web:<host>` for unified search.

---

## Context economy

basemind tools return **paths, line numbers, and signatures — not file bodies** — so a
structural answer costs a fraction of the tokens of reading source. The plugin ships this as
the agent's default operating discipline (carried in the MCP server instructions, the
`basemind` skill, and the SessionStart hook):

- `outline` a file before opening it — then read only the span you need.
- `search_symbols` instead of `grep`/`rg` for a definition.
- `find_references` / `find_callers` instead of grepping call sites.
- `workspace_grep` instead of shelling out to ripgrep for regex over content.
- `rescan` after edits instead of reconnecting the server.
- Don't re-read a file basemind already mapped.

The plugin also ships a PreToolUse **guard hook** that reaches the agent at the moment it reaches
for search: by default (`BASEMIND_GUARD=nudge`) it points `Grep`/`Glob` calls at the matching
basemind tool, once per session. Set `BASEMIND_GUARD=redirect` to enforce it (the call is blocked
with a pointer to the basemind tool) or `BASEMIND_GUARD=off` to disable.

The live statusline surfaces the payoff: estimated tokens saved vs a grep + read baseline.

## Quickstart

### Claude Code

These are **two separate steps** — run both, in order:

```text
/plugin marketplace add Goldziher/basemind   # 1. register the marketplace (makes the plugin available)
/plugin install basemind@basemind            # 2. install the plugin (registers the MCP server)
```

Adding the marketplace alone does **not** give you any tools — it only makes the plugin available to
install. You must run the second command (or pick **Install** for the `basemind` plugin in the
`/plugin` menu) to register the MCP server. If no basemind tools appear after a restart, you almost
certainly stopped after step 1; open `/plugin`, go into the **basemind** marketplace, and **Install**
the plugin.

Restart the session after installing. The basemind binary installs automatically on first use (via
npx, uvx, or direct download with checksum verification) — no manual `cargo install` needed.

#### Statusline

To enable the live statusline, run `/bm-statusline` once. This is a one-time opt-in because **Claude
Code plugins cannot set the main statusline** — it is a platform limitation, not a basemind choice:

- The plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) has no `statusLine` field.
- A plugin-shipped `settings.json` honors only `agent` and `subagentStatusLine`; any `statusLine` key
  is silently ignored.
- Hooks communicate via stdout/stderr/exit codes only — a SessionStart hook **cannot** write to
  `~/.claude/settings.json`, so it can only _nudge_ you to run `/bm-statusline`.

`/bm-statusline` works because Claude (the agent) performs the settings edit on your behalf, writing
an **absolute** path into `~/.claude/settings.json` (`$HOME`/`~` are not expanded in the statusLine
command field). After that it persists across sessions.

Output: `◆ basemind  ●  1,247 files · 23m ago  │  47 calls · 14k saved`. Counts render bright; the
state dot is green (serve active / scan < 1 h), amber (idle or scan 1–24 h), or red (no serve and
stale index). When a document/memory/web index is present, a third segment appears: `│  312 docs ·
18 mem · 4 sites`. Narrow terminals collapse to `◆ basemind ● 1.2k · 23m │ 47c · 14k saved`.

### Any MCP client

```bash
cargo install basemind --features full --locked
```

Then add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "basemind": {
      "command": "basemind",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

Supported harnesses: Claude Code · Cursor · Codex (CLI + App) · Gemini · OpenCode · Factory Droid ·

### CLI only

```bash
basemind scan                     # index the working tree
basemind query outline path/file.rs  # inspect structure
basemind query symbol "parseQuery"   # find by name
basemind watch                    # live re-index on file change
```

## Why basemind, specifically

### vs grep / ripgrep

**What ripgrep does well:** blazing-fast line matching. **What it misses:**

- Grep returns 50+ hits in docs, tests, comments, variable names — agent wastes context filtering noise.
- No scope awareness: `parseQuery()` and `parseQuery` string both match; semantic signals lost.
- Every query re-scans the disk; no pre-computed structures to leverage.

basemind: semantic-quality answers at grep speed via tree-sitter + indexed call sites.

### vs vector-only RAG (LangChain / LlamaIndex DIY stacks)

**What vector RAG does well:** fuzzy document semantic search. **What it misses:**

- Pure embeddings lose exact structure — which function calls which, which class implements which interface.
- No line/column resolution — agent can't map vector hits back to code symbols.
- No git history integration — "what changed recently?" and "who wrote this?" require separate systems.

basemind: code structure + git history + vector memory + document search all in one, unified scope.

### vs context7 / openai-codex / Aider's repo-map

**What these do well:** generate code-map summaries. **What they miss:**

- Static snapshots — stale after the first edit.
- No semantic indexing — every lookup re-parses or re-scans.
- Human-focused output (markdown) instead of agent-facing structure (JSON tools).

basemind: live-updated index with sub-millisecond MCP tools, built for agents not humans.

### vs GitHub native search

**What GitHub does well:** repository-wide fuzzy text search. **What it misses:**

- Cloud-only — your code leaves the machine, latency is network-bound.
- No local-editor integration — agent can't query in-progress edits before commit.
- No cross-language polyglot support — each language's search tuned separately.

basemind: local-only, always-fresh index of your working tree, 300+ languages in one sweep.

## Performance

Measured on Apple Silicon, release build, `--features full`, default `eager_l2 = true`. Cold
filesystem cache adds ~50% to first scan; numbers below are warm steady-state.

### Scan throughput

| Repo | Files | Language mix | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| tokio | 859 | Rust | 0.2 s |
| react | 7 061 | TS / JSX | 2.2 s |
| django | 7 061 | Python | 2.5 s |
| requests | 2 195 | Python | 0.7 s |
| gin | 1 217 | Go | 1.0 s |
| ripgrep | 12 851 | Rust | 4.0 s |
| ripgrep-shallow | 12 851 | Rust | 0.16 s |
| TypeScript compiler | 81 324 | TS / JS / JSON | ~22 s |

The TypeScript compiler is the worst case — 81k files scanned in 22 seconds. Most real repos sit
between tokio and ripgrep. Re-scans skip unchanged content hashes, so warm rescans on edited
working trees are typically dominated by the changed-set size, not repo size.

### Per-tool MCP latency

Against the 81k-file TypeScript index:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Latency | Tools |
|---|---|
| < 1 ms | `outline`, `list_files`, `find_references`, `find_callers`, `find_implementations`, `hot_files`, `repo_info` |
| 3–6 ms | `search_symbols`, `call_graph` |
| 4–10 ms | `recent_changes`, `commits_touching`, `find_commits_by_path`, `symbol_history`, `diff_outline`, `diff_file` |
| 20–25 ms | `status` |
| 30–40 ms | `blame_file`, `blame_symbol` |
| 40–200 ms | `workspace_grep` |
| ~200 ms | `search_documents` |
| 350–600 ms | `working_tree_status` |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

basemind preloads L1 outlines into RAM on `serve` start, so code-map queries hit no disk. The Fjall
LSM inverted index handles ref/caller/impl lookups without scanning blobs. Git tools track `gix`
walk cost; Fjall-backed tools dominate only on enormous histories.

---

## Configuration

Full config lives at `schema/basemind-config-v1.schema.json`. Minimal example:

```toml
# .basemind/basemind.toml
file_watch_glob = "**/*.{rs,ts,tsx,py,go}"
eager_l2 = true

[documents]
enabled = true
```

Per-query MCP overrides:

```json
{
  "query": "what does kreuzberg do?",
  "reranker_enabled": true,
  "reranker_preset": "bge-reranker-base"
}
```

Environment variables map mechanically: `--llm-api-key` ↔ `BASEMIND_LLM_API_KEY`. Every MCP tool
accepts per-query overrides that win over file/env/CLI layers.
