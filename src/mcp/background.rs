/// `.basemind/.lock` flock — the reason we cannot reuse `watcher::watch`, which

/// thread, but `scan_and_refresh` is async. We capture the current tokio runtime
/// `Handle` at spawn time and `handle.block_on(...)` the refresh inside the
/// callback. `block_on` is safe here because the callback runs on a plain OS
/// thread with no tokio runtime entered (it's `std::thread`, not a worker), so
/// the "cannot block the current thread from within a runtime" guard never trips.

/// `spawn_view_watcher`. The `shutdown` oneshot sender is dropped immediately, so
/// `watch_paths`'s `shutdown.try_recv()` returns `Disconnected` only if the loop
/// ever polls it after the sender drops — in practice the loop exits when the
