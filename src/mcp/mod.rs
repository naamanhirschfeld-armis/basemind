//! MCP server exposing the basemind code map + git context to AI agents.
//!
//! The server opens the store writably and is the canonical Fjall owner: it holds the exclusive
//! lock so the in-process `rescan` tool (and the background watcher) can refresh the index. While
//! a server is running, standalone `basemind scan` / `basemind watch` against the same repo fail
//! fast with a lock error rather than racing it. Tools return JSON so the agent can navigate by
//! file path + line numbers without opening source files.
//!
//! Transport: stdio (the canonical MCP transport). Spawn via `basemind serve`.

             tree-sitter code map across 300+ languages (symbols, references, callers, call \
             graphs, implementations), git history + blame at symbol resolution, full-text + \
             semantic search, document RAG over 90+ file formats, and shared cross-session \
             memory. basemind first, shell/grep/git fallback: prefer these tools over reading \
             files, over grep, and over naked `git` — and use them for document extraction, web \
             crawling, and code parsing too. You may be one of several agents in this repo: on \
             start, check the comms room and post status as you work (see Agent comms below).\n\
             Context economy — these tools return paths, line numbers, and signatures, not \
             file bodies, so they cost a fraction of the tokens of reading source. Default to \
             them: `outline` a file before you open it (then read only the span you need); \
             `search_symbols` instead of grep for a definition; `find_references` / \
             `find_callers` instead of grepping call sites; `workspace_grep` instead of \
             shelling out to ripgrep; `rescan` after edits instead of reconnecting. Do not \
             re-read a file basemind already mapped. Same discipline beyond code: use the git \
             tools (`recent_changes` / `blame_*` / `diff_*` / `commits_touching`) instead of \
             shelling out to `git log`/`git blame`; `search_documents` and the documents \
             pipeline for extraction, RAG, keyword + entity (NER), and summary instead of \
             opening files; `web_scrape` / `web_crawl` / `web_map` for scraping, crawling, and \
             sitemaps.\n\
             Routing: \
             \"where is X defined?\" → `search_symbols`; \
             \"what calls X?\" → `find_references` (any name) or `find_callers` (specific def); \
             \"shape of this file?\" → `outline` (add `l2: true` for calls + docs); \
             \"what changed recently?\" → `recent_changes`, `commits_touching`, `symbol_history`; \
             \"who last touched this?\" → `blame_file` / `blame_symbol`; \
             \"where's the churn?\" → `hot_files`; \
             \"semantic search across PDFs/docs in the repo?\" → `search_documents`; \
             \"recall something the agent remembered earlier?\" → `memory_get` / `memory_list` / \
             `memory_search`; \
             \"remember this for later sessions?\" → `memory_put` (delete with `memory_delete`); \
             \"refresh the index after editing code?\" → `rescan` (or `rescan { paths: [...] }` \
             to limit to changed files); \
             \"any other agents working here / leave a note for the next session?\" → \
             `room_list` / `inbox_read` / `room_post`.\n\
             \"got a truncated result? fetch the next page?\" → pass `next_cursor` from the prior \
             response back as `cursor`.\n\
             \"need regex over file contents?\" → `workspace_grep`.\n\
             Code-map tools: `outline`, `search_symbols`, `find_references`, `find_callers`, \
             `list_files`, `workspace_grep`, `dependents`, `status`, `repo_info`, \
             `symbol_history`. \
             Git tools (inside a repo): `working_tree_status`, `recent_changes`, `commits_touching`, \
             `find_commits_by_path`, `hot_files`, `diff_outline`, `diff_file`, `blame_file`, \
             `blame_symbol`. \
             Intelligence tools (require build with `--features documents,memory`): \
             `search_documents`, `memory_put`, `memory_get`, `memory_list`, `memory_search`, \
             `memory_delete`. \
             Web tools (require build with `--features crawl`): `web_scrape` (one URL), \
             `web_crawl` (follow links from a seed URL), `web_map` (sitemap-only discovery). \
             Crawled pages land in the same LanceDB documents table as on-disk docs, scoped \
             under `web:<host>` — find them later with `search_documents`. \
             Agent comms (require build with `--features comms`): you may share this repo's \
             rooms with other agents working alongside you. On start, check `room_list` + \
             `inbox_read` (and recent `room_history`) for what's been said; `room_history` and \
             `inbox_read` return front-matter only (subject / from / id) — call `message_get` \
             with an id for a body. Post a concise `room_post {room, subject, body, reply_to?}` \
             when you begin, finish, or hit a decision, and reply (`reply_to`) to messages \
             about your work — do not stay silent when collaborating. Tools: `room_list`, \
             `room_join`, `room_post`, `room_history`, `inbox_read`, `message_get`, \
             `room_create`, `room_leave`, `agent_register`, `agent_list`. \
             All paths are repository-relative with forward-slash separators. \
             If a tool reports \"no indexed files\", run `basemind scan` in the repo first.",
        )
    }
