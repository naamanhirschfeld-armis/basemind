//! The ONE-SHOT CLI's git-history reads must come from the index, in both deployments.
//!
//! `basemind serve` was routed through the daemon's git-history index; the CLI (`basemind git …`,
//! which runs the identical MCP tool bodies in-process and exits) was not. Fjall's directory lock is
//! exclusive even for a read-only open, so when a machine daemon is up it is the SOLE holder of
//! `git-history.fjall/` — and a CLI that tries to open it locally cannot: it burns the lock-retry
//! ladder, gives up, and silently live-walks every git query, forever, on the exact machine where the
//! index is built and healthy.
//!
//! These tests pin the routing contract:
//!
//! * **daemon up** (a `comms` build): the CLI reads the daemon's index over the socket, and pays no
//!   lock-retry penalty at startup.
//! * **no daemon** (standalone / non-`comms` build): the CLI opens the index locally, as before.
//!
//! The observable is `search_git_history`'s `partial` flag: it is set exactly when the tool fell back
//! to walking git live (a bounded window, no posting lists), and omitted — `false` — when the answer
//! came from the index. It is both the honest degradation signal the tools already ship and the only
//! thing that separates the two data sources on a repo small enough for the live window to cover.
