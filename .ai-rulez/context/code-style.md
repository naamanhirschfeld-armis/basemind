# Code Style

Project-specific conventions baked into context so they ship into every AI tool's config.

## Module layout

- One concern per file. When `src/mcp/tools.rs` accumulated to 1057 lines after iter-3, the bodies were extracted to `helpers.rs`; that's the canonical split for the `tools.rs` cap.
- 1000-line cap on `src/**/*.rs` enforced by the `rust-max-lines` prek hook. Refactor by extracting helpers or types, never by lifting the cap.
- Tests sit in `tests/<area>_smoke.rs` files (one per area) plus the integration harness at `tests/harden.rs`.

## Performance

- `ahash` for hash maps, never `std::collections::HashMap` on hot paths.
- `memchr::memmem::Finder` for substring matching — built once and reused.
- Zero-copy hex encoding via `src/store.rs`; do not introduce `String::from_utf8(hex::encode(...))` round-trips.
- Cache MCP import lookups; never re-parse imports per query.
- Rayon `par_iter` is the scanner parallelism unit; no `tokio::spawn` in the scanner.

## Testing & lints

- TDD: failing test first when the change is observable via the public API or MCP surface.
- Clippy strict (`-D warnings`); silence only with a one-line `//` justification.
- `prek run -a` covers: typos, markdown line length, cargo fmt / clippy / sort / machete / deny, rustdoc-lint, rust-max-lines.

## Codegen

- `build.rs` + `schema/*.json` are the codegen surface. Hand-editing generated files is forbidden.
- JSON Schema drives the config types; mismatches between schema and `src/config/v1.rs` are caught by `tests/config_schema.rs`.

## Commits

- Conventional Commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`). Match the style in `git log`.
- Body explains *why*, not *what*. Mention schema bumps explicitly.
