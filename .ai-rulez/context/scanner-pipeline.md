# Scanner Pipeline

`gitmind scan` is the engine. Two entry points: full scan (`scanner::scan`) and incremental (`scanner::scan_paths`). Both share the same per-file pipeline.

```text
Walker (gitignore-aware)
  → filter by extension + size cap
  → rayon par_iter
    → process_file(rel, contents):
        L1 outline   (always)         — extract::l1
        L2 calls     (eager if cfg)   — extract::l2
        Store::write_l1               — content-addressed msgpack blob
        Store::write_l2 (if eager)
        IndexWriter::upsert_file(...) — Fjall secondary index
        per-file commit               — atomic batch
  → collect FileResult { rel, l1_hash, l2_hash?, … }
  → apply_outcomes:
        write Index meta
        prune deleted files via IndexWriter::remove_file
```

## Key invariants

- **Per-file commit**: every `process_file` commits its Fjall batch before returning. Fjall handles cross-thread locking; the scanner does not.
- **Atomic upsert**: `IndexWriter::upsert_file` is read-before-write — it reads existing primary entries first to derive secondary-index keys for deletion, then stages all deletes + inserts in one batch. No torn state on re-scan.
- **Eager L2 cost**: scanning TypeScript at 39k files goes 13.5 s → ~23 s with eager L2 on. Document the trade-off when enabling; offer the `eager_l2 = false` escape hatch.
- **`scan_paths` removal mirror**: when a file disappears between scans, `scan_paths` calls `IndexWriter::remove_file` so secondary indexes don't leak stale entries.
- **No `tokio::spawn`** on the scanner path — rayon `par_iter` is the parallelization unit.

## Where to extend

- New language → add a tree-sitter parser registration in `extract::l1::extract` and `extract::l2::extract`, plus the file extension in the scanner glob.
- New extraction tier (e.g. `l4` semantic types) → mirror the `l1`/`l2` shape: `extract/l4.rs`, blob suffix `.l4.msgpack`, optional eager toggle in `ScanConfig`.
- New index partition → see the `index-keyspace-evolution` skill.
